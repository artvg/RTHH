# RTHH *(Phase 1)*  
Detecting AI hallucinations across local and cloud models using Python, PyTorch, and Ollama.

Current Phase: Phase 1 — Local Testing
I am currently setting up and testing the detection pipeline using local models (DeepSeek + Gemma) through Ollama.  
  
These early runs are strictly for internal verification — building the foundation for the main experiment that will later analyze real model outputs from ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Grok in Phase 2.  
 
he project will evolve over time, with updates added as milestones are completed.  
 
The full reveal — including insights, results, and a special surprise — will come at the final delivery.

Tools & Tech
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: PyTorch, Transformers, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn  
- Models (Phase 1): DeepSeek, Gemma (via Ollama)  
- Models (Phase 2): ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, Grok  

Project Status
- Phase 1 – Local testing in progress  
- Phase 2 – Official model analysis (coming soon)  

Repo Notes
This repository is under development. Phase 1 will focus on validating the hallucination detection workflow.  
Future commits will include data collection scripts, prompt testing modules, and final result summaries.  

Stay tuned RTHH has something extra planned for the finale (Its the name).
